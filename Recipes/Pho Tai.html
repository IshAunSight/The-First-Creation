      <ol>

      <li>

       <!-- First Step -->

         Bring a pressure cooker full of water to a rolling boil.

          Add the oxtail and brisket to the boiling water and return to a boil.

           Set the timer for 12 minutes, after the water returns to a boil. Prepare a bowl of cold water. </li>

        </li>

        
        <li>
          
         <!-- Second Step -->

          While the bones are boiling, put the onion and Ginger on a sheet pan and place directly under

            the heating element of your broiler, cut side up.

             When the timer goes off, remove the oxtail and brisket and transfer them to the water to chill.

        </li>


        <li>

         <!-- Third Step -->

           Wash the bones thoroughly to remove any congealed blood, or other contaminants that can cloud your soup. Wash the pot out well,

            and then add the bones and meat back in.
          
        </li> 

        
        <li>

         <!-- Fourth Step -->

          Put the cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds and cloves into a pan and roast on the stove,

           tossing frequently to prevent burning, until the spices are fragrant.

        </li> 

            
            <li> 

             <!-- Fifth Step -->

             Add the roasted spices to the pot with the brisket and bones and then add the cilantro roots and 8 cups of water.

              Seal the lid and bring the cooker up to high pressure. When it's at pressure, set the timer for 30 minutes.

            </li> 


            <li>
             
             <!-- Sixth Step -->

               When the timer goes off, use the quick release method to release the pressure from your cooker

                and when the pressure has gone down, open the lid. Remove the brisket, and quickly wrap it in plastic wrap,

                to prevent the meat from drying out.

                Let this come down to room temperature and store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.

            </li>


            <li>

             <!-- Step 7 -->

               Seal the lid to the pressure cooker again and bring the pot back up to high pressure.

                Continue cooking the broth for another 45 minutes and then let the pressure drop naturally.

            </li>


            <li>

             <!-- Step 8 -->

              When the pressure has dropped, open the lid and use tongs to remove the oxtail and

               set aside(you can pick the meat and connective tissue off the oxtails to serve on top of your Pho,
               
               or season it and press it into a terrine).

               Pass the stock through a fine mesh sieve to remove the aromatics and then skim off most, but not all, of the fat.

            </li>


            <li> 

             <!-- Step 9 -->

              You should now have 5 cups of stock. If you have less, add some water to make 5 cups.

               If you have more, you will need to boil your stock down a little more to concentrate it.         

            </li>


            <li>

             <!-- Step 10 -->

              To prepare the Pho, soak the banh pho in warm water for an hour to rehydrate.

               When the noodles no longer have a tough core, drain them.

                You can store them in a sealable plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to a day.

            </li>


            <li>

             <!-- Step 11 -->

              Put the prepared stock in a pot and add the fish sauce and evaporated cane juice,

               adjusting both to taste. Keep the Pho broth warm over low heat.

            </li>

             
            <li>

             <!-- Step 12 -->

              Because the noodles will get soggy quickly be sure to have your table prepped with condiments

               and have all your toppings prepared so you can assemble all the bowls and get them to the table as quickly as possible.

            </li>


            <li>

             <!-- Step 13 -->

              Slice the onion as thinly as possible and then soak them in water.

               Slice the cooked brisket. Slice the tenderloin as thinly as possible.

            </li>


            <li>

             <!-- Step 14 -->

              Bring a large pot of water to a boil. The rehydrated noodles should cook in about 1 minute,

               so have a strainer ready and add the noodles to the boiling water. Drain as soon as they're cooked

                (you'll want them to still be a little chewy as they will continue to cook in the bowls with the broth).
                
            </li>


            <li>
 
             <!-- Last Step aka Step 15 -->

              Divide the noodles between your bowls and top with the sliced onions, cilantro, brisket and raw tenderloin.

               Bring the Pho broth to a boil and divide it between the bowls and serve with the rest of the condiments and toppings.

            </li>
          
          </ol>
