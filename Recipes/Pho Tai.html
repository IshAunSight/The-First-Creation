      <ol>

       <!-- First Step -->

        <li> Bring a pressure cooker full of water to a rolling boil.

          Add the oxtail and brisket to the boiling water and return to a boil.

           Set the timer for 12 minutes, after the water returns to a boil. Prepare a bowl of cold water. </li>

        <li> 

         <!-- Second Step -->

          While the bones are boiling, put the onion and

           Ginger on a sheet pan and place directly under

            the heating element of your broiler, cut side up.

        <li> When the timer goes off, remove the oxtail and brisket and transfer them to the water to chill.

         <!-- Third Step -->

           Wash the bones thoroughly to remove any congealed blood, or other contaminants that can cloud your soup. Wash the pot out well,

            and then add the bones and meat back in.
          
        <li> 

         <!-- Fourth Step -->

          Put the cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds and cloves into a pan and roast on the stove,

           tossing frequently to prevent burning, until the spices are fragrant.

          <li> 

           
            
            <li> 

             <!-- Fifth Step -->

              Add the roasted spices to the pot with the brisket and bones and then add the cilantro roots and 8 cups of water.

               Seal the lid and bring the cooker up to high pressure. When it's at pressure, set the timer for 30 minutes.

            <li> 

             <!-- Sixth Step -->

              When the timer goes off, use the quick release method to release the pressure from your cooker
               and when the pressure has gone down, open the lid. Remove the brisket, and quickly wrap it in plastic wrap, to prevent the meat from drying out.
                Let this come down to room temperature and store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.
