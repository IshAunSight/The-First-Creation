   <ol>

    <li> 

     Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat,

     stirring until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool.
      
    </li>


     <p> </p>


    <li> 

      Place carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture

       and let marinate at least 30 minutes. While vegetables marinate,

       set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.
      
    </li>


     <p> </p>


     <li> 

      Sprinkle chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper.

     </li>


     <p> </p>


     <li>
      
      Place chicken on the prepared pan and broil, turning once,

       until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side.
      
     </li>


     <p> </p>


     <li>

      Place chicken on a cutting board. Cut into bite-sized pieces.

     </li>


     <p> </p>


     <li> 

      Slice baguette in half lengthwise. Pull out the soft

       center of the bread, leaving a cavity for the fillings.

     </li>


     <p> </p>


     <li> 
      
      Lightly toast baguette under the broiler, 2 to 3 minutes. 

     </li>


     <p> </p>


     <li> 
      
      Drain off excess vinegar mixture after vegetables have marinated. 
   
     </li>
